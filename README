These scripts generate user statistics for software development platforms such as git, trac, phabricator and irc.

Requirements:

	git:
		To generate git commit statistics, one needs a git clone at:
			input/git/

	trac:
		To generate trac statistics, one needs a wget mirror of a trac instance, at least of each ticket html:
			input/trac/ticket/X.html

	irc:
		To generate chat statistics, one needs an irclogs folder in irssi chatlog format:
			input/irc/year/year-month/

	events:
		To have custom events (date + label pair) in charts, add this file (see input/events_example.json):
			input/events.json

	software:
		python3
		matplotlib module
		date
		sort

Statistics generation (txt files):

	git:
		Adapt the git arguments in the script files.
		Currently only the month data is used for charts.

			obtain_git_stats/git_stats.sh

	trac:
		To compute the statistics of trac, run this command:
			python3 obtain_trac_stats/parse_trac_tickets.py

		This generates several files indicating how often individual users added or removed the "review" or "rfc" keyword and
		how many tickets existed at a given month that had these keywords.

	irc:
		To compute the irc chat statistics per user per month, edit the wfgparser.py user list and run
		python3 obtain_irc_stats/wfgparser.py > data/irc_month.txt

To generate the charts:
	python3 plot.py
